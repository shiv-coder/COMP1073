const output = document.getElementById('output');

/* STEP 1a: Create a new object using a regular function */


/* STEP 1b: Use the console to create a new vehicle object, and then invoke the function represented using .description() */


/* STEP 2a: In order to be a bit more concise, JavaScript allows us to use constructor functions - rewrite the above function, without returning anything. Capitalize the name of the function. */


/* STEP 2b: Use the console to create a couple of different albums, using the 'new' keyword, and again invoking the .describe() method for each one */


/* STEP 3a: Build the complete constructor for the object Vehicle (comment out the above functions first). Include full vehicle name (manufacturer and model), year, type, colour, and description (function). */



/* STEP 3b: Instantiate a new Album (or 2) based on the above constructor */


/* STEP 3c: Attempt to access the various properties of album2 or album3 using the console. */
// album2['name']
// album2['artist']
// album2.numTracks
// album2.year
/* STEP 3d: Invoke a method belonging to one of the Vehicle objects */
// album2.describe()
// album3.describe()

/* STEP 4a: Modify the describe method of the above Album constructor so that it returns a string. */

/* STEP 4b: Capture the description of one of the album objects and set it as the text for the paragraph on the page (see line 1 of this script). */
