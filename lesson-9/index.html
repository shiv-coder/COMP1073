	<h1>Object Prototypes</h1>
	<p>JavaScript objects inherit features from one another using Prototypes. Each and every <code>object</code> features a <code>prototype</code> object that functions as a template from which it inherits methods and properties. Such objects may also contain their own <code>prototype</code> objects from which they <em>also</em> inherit various methods and propertiesâ€¦and so on. This chain of inheritance is called the <dfn>prototype chain</dfn>.</p>
