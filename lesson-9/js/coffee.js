/* STEP 1: Instead of a constructor function, let's try a JavaScript class called 'Coffee' */

/* STEP 2: Instatiate a coffee based on the above constructor function */

/* STEP 3: Add a method to the Coffee class called serveIt() */

/* STEP 4: Call up the serveIt() method */

/* STEP 5: Define a subclass of the Coffee class */

/* STEP 6: Create a new instance of the Latte object */

/* STEP 7: Call up the latteDesc() method for the above created Latte instance */

/* STEP 8: Create yet another instance of Latte using the console, and try the latteDesc() method from the subclass, as well as the serveIt() method from the parent class */
