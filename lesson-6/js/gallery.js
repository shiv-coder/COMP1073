// STEP 1: Initialize and declare variables


/* STEP 2: Loop 5 times to create the <img> elements */

		/* STEP 3a: Create a new DOM node - an image element */

		/* STEP 3b: Set the src attribute to be the path of one of the images inside the images folder, using setAttribute() */

		/* Append the new image element to the thumbBar div, named in STEP 1 */

		/* STEP 3c: Build event handler for each <img> */


/* STEP 4: Function to change the src of the main <img> */

	// Rewrite the src attribute of the .displayed-img element


/* STEP 5: Event Delegation
Instead of adding event handlers for each image, how about event delegation? Build a click handler on the parent element, and capture each target (and its attributes) from the event object */

	// event.target is the element that was clicked

		// grab the src attribute of the element that was clicked

		// change the main image
		

		// Lab 6 STEP G: Call the clearWayfinding() function that you built below - and enjoy the result!

		// Lab 6 STEP A: Inside the thumbBar.onclick event handler function, and also inside the if statement, change the event.target CSS outline property to "5px solid red"

		// Lab 6 STEP B: Next, change the event.target CSS position property to "relative"

		// Lab 6 STEP C: And then set the CSS z-index property to "10" so that the thumbnail clicked is on top of all the others


// Lab 6 STEP D: Initialize and declare a var called 'thumbImgs' using the querySelectorAll method to grab all the IMG elements inside the .thumb-bar


// Lab 6 STEP E: Build a function called 'clearWayfinding()' that loops through the thumbImgs array with a FOR loop

		// Lab 6 STEP F: For each thumbImgs IMG element, set the CSS outline-width property to "0", and the z-index property also to "0"
